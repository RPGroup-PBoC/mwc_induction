# Equipment : MACSQuant (Bjorkman lab)
# Description : 
# LacI titration with 4 different operators (O1, O2, O3 and Oid) 
# and 7 different RBS (delta, HG104, RBS1147, RBS446, RBS1027, RBS1 and RBS1L)
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + Kan + Spec and then
# diluted next morning 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in deep 96-well plates.
# Because of this format we were able to have 3 biological replicas for each of the strains.
# The files are named 20160726_rbs_operator_0mMIPTG_0X where X is the number of replica
# indexing from 0.
# Comments : 
# It seems that since before measuring we dilute the cells 1:10 into fresh M9 the cells are
# doubling while being measured. The flow cytometer takes about 2.5 hours to measure a 96-well
# plate and despite the fact that they are resting on a "chill" block I believe they
# are still capable of doubling.
