# Equipment : MACSQuant (Bjorkman lab)
# Description : 
# LacI titration with 4 different operators (O1, O2, O3 and Oid) 
# and 7 different RBS (delta, HG104, RBS1147, RBS446, RBS1027, RBS1 and RBS1L)
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + Kan + Spec and then
# diluted next morning 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in deep 96-well plates.
# Because of this format we were able to have 3 biological replicas for each of the strains.
# The files are named 20160725_rbs_operator_0mMIPTG_0X where X is the number of replica
# indexing from 0.
# Comments : 
# The machine ran out of space for waste during the middle of the measurement so the actual
# reading took much longer than it should have. The 96-well plate was on the "chill 96-well"
# holder which remained cold but this could definitely have affected the last measurements.
