# Description : 
# IPTG titration with all the O1+11 YFP strains RBS (delta, HG104, RBS1147, RBS446, RBS1027, RBS1 and RBS1L)
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + Kan + Spec and then
# diluted next morning 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in deep 96-well plates with the following
# IPTG concentrations:
# 0uM, 0.1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM, 500uM, 1000uM, 5000uM
# Comments :
# I got confused took out the plate 30 minutes before the 8 hours.
# The OD600 for the first well, i.e. auto 5 mM was 0.36.
# The flow rate at the cytometer was low (1000 to 2000 events per second)
# I am sure that I screwed the 8th column of the plate diluting two different concentrations into the same row.
