# Description : 
# IPTG titration with all the rbs1027 strains (O1 and O2 wt and wt_diemr)
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + spec. Then they were
# diluted next morning 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in deep 96-well plates with the following
# IPTG concentrations:
# 0uM, 0.1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM, 500uM, 1000uM, 5000uM
# Comments :
# The flow rate at the cytometer was very high (25-20k/sec) so I switched to low flow rate which put it down to around 5000/sec
