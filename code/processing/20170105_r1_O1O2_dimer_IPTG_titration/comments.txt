# Description :
# IPTG titration with all the rbs1027 strains (O1 and O2 wt and wt_dimer)
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + spec. Delta and HG104 also had Kan, while the other LacI strains had spec, kan, and chlor. Then they were
# diluted at 2 am of this day at 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in deep 96-well plates with the following
# IPTG concentrations:
# 0uM, 0.1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM, 500uM, 1000uM, 5000uM
# Comments :
# The flow rate looked normal. This was the 10am run with Rob et al.
