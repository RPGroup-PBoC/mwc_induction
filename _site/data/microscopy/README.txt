Microscopy Data for "An Allosteric Theory of Transcription Factor Induction"
============================================================================

All data here are provided as .tif or .ome.tif files. Each experimental run is
separated by date. If multiple runs occurred per day, these are designated by
the date followed by a run number identifier `_r#`. Comments regarding the
experiment can be found in the "Comments" folder. 

Please note that all folder names are correct for the sample and IPTG
concentration. However, there are issues with some of the *image* filenames
being incorrect. To avoid corruption of the `ome.tif` metadata, the image names
were left incorrect while their parent folder was correctly renamed. This
occurred on only a few occasions. 

Please contact Griffin Chure `gchure@caltech.edu` or `griffinchure@gmail.com`
for any questions or concerns.
