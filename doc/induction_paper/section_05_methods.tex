\subsection{Creation of LacI RBS and Operator mutants}
Strains were created as is described in \citep{Garcia2011}. Briefly, xxx.

\subsection{Growth conditions for flow cytometry measurements.}
For detailed growth and measurement conditions, please see the supplementary
text. Briefly, overnight 500mL cultures of Lysogeny Broth (BD LB DETAILS)
\textit{E. coli} strains (as is described above in section [XX]), were
inoculated from a 50\% glycerol frozen stock and were grown overnight in a 2mL
96-deep-well plate sealed with a breatheable nylon cover (XXX) with rapid
agitation for aeration. After approximately 12 - 15 hours, the cultures had
reached saturation. The cells were diluted 1000-fold into 500mL of M9 minimal
media (XXX) containing 0.5\% w/v glucose (XXX) and were sealed with a
breatheable cover and allowed to grow for approximately eight hours unless
otherwise noted. Cells were then diluted ten-fold into a round-bottom 96 well
plate (XXX) containing 90ÂµL of M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.5\% w/v
glucose along with the corresponding IPTG concentrations. These samples were
then analyzed using flow cytometry.

\subsection{Flow cytometry.}

\subsection{Unsupervised gating of flow cytometry data.}

\subsection{Parameter estimation and fitting.}

\subsection{Data curation.}
All data was collected, stored, and preserved using the Git version control
software in combination with off-site storage and hosting website GitHub. Code
used to generate all figures and complete all analyses are available on the GitHub
repository. Many analysis files are stored as instructive Jupyter Notebooks. The
scientific community is invited to fork our repositories and open constructive issues
on the repository which can be located at \texttt{https://www.github.com/rpgroup-pboc/mwc_induction}.

Raw flow cytometery data files (\texttt{.fcs} and \texttt{.csv}) files were
stored on-site under redundant storage. Due to size limitations, all raw data
files are available upon request and are not publically hosted.
