\section*{Abstract} 

Processes such as simple repression have been nailed down. Now we can build upon these simple models to understand more complicated interactions such as induction, which serve as the cornerstone for cell sensing and signaling.

Role of prediction in biology, not just to characterize data but to predict future experiments.

Use the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of
allostery to understand the data within a single, unified framework.
