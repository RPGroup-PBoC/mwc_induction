\subsection*{Experimental Design}

To exploit the expression for fold-change \eref[eq7] we used a set of simple
repression \textit{E. coli} constructs with variable repressor copy number $R$ and
operator binding energies $\Delta\varepsilon_{RA}$ (\fref[figpolymeraseRepressorStates]\letter{B}).  The
copy number of LacI in each strain was modified using the ribosomal binding
site to generate strains with mean LacI dimer copy numbers of 22, 60, 124, 260,
1220, and 1740 \cite{Garcia2011}. Gene expression was measured using a Yellow
Fluorescent Protein (YFP) gene regulated by a modified \textit{lacUV5}
promoter. In this promoter, operators of different repressor binding energies
were placed at the YFP transcription start site. Each construct was
chromosomally integrated and expression was quantified using Flow Cytometry as
the concentration of IPTG was titrated between 0 and $5\times
10^{-6}\,\,\text{M}$. In addition a subset of these strains were also examined
by single cell microscopy, particularly those expected to be at the limit of
sensitivity of the flow cytometer.

\subsection*{Determination of the \textit{in vivo} MWC Parameters}

The binding energies and LacI copy number have
previously been measured using either single-cell microscopy or bulk
measurement \cite{Garcia2011, Brewster2014}. This leaves three free parameters
in the fold-change \eref[eq7] that are unknown, $K_I$, $K_A$, and $\Delta\varepsilon_{AI}$, which reflect the binding
affinity of inducer to LacI in the inactive conformation, the binding affinity of
inducer to LacI in the active conformation, and the free energy difference
between these two conformations. From previous data\cite{Brewster2014}, we infer that $\Delta\varepsilon_{AI} = 4.5k_BT$ (see Appendix \ref{AppendixSloppiness}). Since these
two parameters are dependent on the properties of LacI and its interaction with
the inducer rather than the specific regulatory context considered, we applied
Bayesian parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to obtain $K_I$ and
$K_A$ using fold-change data from a single strain and then used those to
predict expression for the remaining 23 strains with no further fitting.

\fref[fig_result1] shows how we use fold-change measurements from a single
strain with $R=260$ and an O2 operator ($\Delta\varepsilon_{RA}=-13.9k_BT$, orange open diamonds), and infer the
most likely parameter values for $K_I=0.56^{+0.05}_{-0.04} \times 10^{-6}\,\, \text{M}$ and $K_A=141^{+28}_{-23} \times
10^{-6} \,\, \text{M}$ where the error represents the 95\% confidence interval. Using these parameters, we calculated the
fold-change \eref[eq7] and the associated confident interval (orange line \fref[fig_result1]). With all parameters for fold-change determined, we can predict titration curves for any LacI copy number. In \fref[fig_result1] we plot the predictions for five other strains with copy number spanning three orders of magnitude.

\subsection*{Comparison of Experimental Measurements with Theoretical Predictions across Different LacI Copy Numbers and Operator Binding Energies}

In addition to tuning LacI copy number, we can also vary the operator binding energy.
\fref[fig_result2] shows the parameter-free predictions along with experimental
measurements of fold-change for the operators O1, O2, and O3 with operator binding energies of $-15.3, -13.9, -9.7k_BT$ respectively. Each data point reflects the
mean and SEM from ten independent measurements, where each measurement
represents the mean fluorescence of 40,000 cells.

 Across all of our strains with different operators and LacI copy numbers we
find very good agreement between theory and experiment
($R^2=\nathanComment{???}.$). It is of particular importance to note that the experimental data agrees remarkably well with several theoretical predictions. For example, all the O1 operators go to zero fold-change in the absence
of inducer, signifying that the repressor binds very strongly to the operator
and inhibits gene expression almost entirely in this regime. The O3 operator
exhibits the other limit of weak binding, and consequently all strains have fold-change approaching one in the saturating inducer limit, representing that all LacI are inactive and not
inhibiting gene expression. The O2 operator shows an intermediate trend
between these two operators with a small spread of fold-change values both in
the presence and absence of inducer. Another common trend seen in the data is
that all 24 strains transition from their minimum to maximum fold-change
between $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3} \,\, \text{M}$ IPTG, without any significant
shift left or right.

Another interesting aspect of the theoretical predictions is the width of the confidence intervals, which increases with repressor copy number and inducer concentration. The four strains with lowest copy number, including the wild type strain $R=22$, have tightly constrained fold-change predictions, which implies that changing any of the model parameters by 10\% negligibly changes the fold-change. The confidence intervals for all O3 operator strains are tightly constrained even for those with high repressor copy number. This is likely due to the fact that this operator binding energy is weak, resulting in moderately high gene expression even in the presence of more than 1000 repressors \griffinComment{right?}\nathanComment{???}.

\end{figure}

We note that rather than using $R=260$ for O2, we could have used any of the strains to estimate $K_I$ and $K_A$, and we consider all such possibilities in Appendix \ref{AppendixParamEstimation}. As an alternative approach, we could also perform a global fit using data from all 24 strains to obtain the best estimate of $K_I$ and $K_A$ for the LacI system (Appendix \ref{AppendixParamEstimation}). The close agreement between each of these methods demonstrates our quantitative understanding of induction in the simple repression architecture.

\subsection*{Data Collapse of 24 Strains onto One Master Curve}

One beautiful aspect of the MWC model is that it offers a unifying perspective with which to understand all 24 seemingly different induction profiles. To demonstrate this, we rewrite \eref[eq7] in the following form,
\begin{equation}\label{eq8}
\foldchange= \frac{1}{1+e^{-\beta F(c)}} ,
\end{equation}
where we call $F(c)$ the Bohr parameter \cite{Phillips2016}, with $F(c)$ given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq10}
F(c) = - k_BT \left( \log \frac{\left(1+\frac{c}{K_A}\right)^2}{\left(1+\frac{c}{K_A}\right)^2+e^{-\beta  \Delta\varepsilon_{AI} }\left(1+\frac{c}{K_I}\right)^2} + \log \frac{R}{N_{\text{NS}}} e^{- \beta \Delta\varepsilon_{RA}} \right).
\end{equation}
\fref[fig_result3] shows the experimental fold-change data as a function of the Bohr parameter, with all 198 data points from 24 strains collapsing onto a single master curve. This collapse emphasizes that the seemingly different response curves in \fref[fig_result2] all arise from a unified model with a single set of thermodynamic parameters.
