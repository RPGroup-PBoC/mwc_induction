abstract = {Transcriptional networks across all domains of life feature a wide range of regulatory architectures. Theoretical models now make clear predictions about how key parameters describing those architectures modulate gene expression, and the ability to construct genetic circuits with tunable parameters enables precise tests of such models. We dissect gene regulation through DNA looping by tuning network parameters such as repressor copy number, DNA binding strengths, and loop length in both thermodynamic models and experiments. Our results help clarify the short-length mechanical properties of DNA.},

@article{Einav2016,
abstract = {The concept of allostery in which macromolecules switch between two different conformations, is a central theme in biological processes ranging from gene regulation to cell signaling to enzymology. Allosteric enzymes pervade metabolic processes, yet a simple and unified treatment of the effects of allostery in enzymes has been lacking. In this work, we take the first step towards this goal by modeling allosteric enzymes and their interaction with two key molecular players - allosteric regulators and competitive inhibitors. We then apply this model to characterize existing data on enzyme activity, comment on how enzyme parameters (such as substrate binding affinity) can be experimentally tuned, and make novel predictions on how to control phenomena such as substrate inhibition.},

@article{Endres2006,
abstract = {The chemotaxis network in Escherichia coli is remarkable for its sensitivity to small relative changes in the concentrations of multiple chemical signals over a broad range of ambient concentrations. Key to this sensitivity is an adaptation system that relies on methylation and demethylation (or deamidation) of specific modification sites of the chemoreceptors by the enzymes CheR and CheB, respectively. It was recently discovered that these enzymes can access five to seven receptors when tethered to a particular receptor. We show that these "assistance neighborhoods" are necessary for precise adaptation in a model for signaling by clusters of chemoreceptors. In agreement with experiment, model clusters composed of receptors of different types exhibit high sensitivity and precise adaptation over a wide range of chemical concentrations and the response of adapted clusters to addition/removal of attractant scales with free-energy change. We predict two limits of precise adaptation at large attractant concentrations: Either receptors reach full methylation and turn off, or receptors become saturated and cease to respond to attractant but retain their adapted activity.},

@article{Maecker2005,
abstract = {Cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) or intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) can quantitate antigen-specific T cell responses in settings such as experimental vaccination. Standardization of ICS among laboratories performing vaccine studies would provide a common platform by which to compare the immunogenicity of different vaccine candidates across multiple international organizations conducting clinical trials. As such, a study was carried out among several laboratories involved in HIV clinical trials, to define the inter-lab precision of ICS using various sample types, and using a common protocol for each experiment (see additional files online). Three sample types (activated, fixed, and frozen whole blood; fresh whole blood; and cryopreserved PBMC) were shipped to various sites, where ICS assays using cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 peptide mix or control antigens were performed in parallel in 96-well plates. For one experiment, antigens and antibody cocktails were lyophilised into 96-well plates to simplify and standardize the assay setup. Results (CD4+cytokine+ cells and CD8+cytokine+ cells) were determined by each site. Raw data were also sent to a central site for batch analysis with a dynamic gating template. Mean inter-laboratory coefficient of variation (C.V.) ranged from 17–44{\%} depending upon the sample type and analysis method. Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) yielded lower inter-lab C.V.'s than whole blood. Centralized analysis (using a dynamic gating template) reduced the inter-lab C.V. by 5–20{\%}, depending upon the experiment. The inter-lab C.V. was lowest (18–24{\%}) for samples with a mean of {\textgreater}0.5{\%} IFN$\gamma$ + T cells, and highest (57–82{\%}) for samples with a mean of {\textless}0.1{\%} IFN$\gamma$ + cells. ICS assays can be performed by multiple laboratories using a common protocol with good inter-laboratory precision, which improves as the frequency of responding cells increases. Cryopreserved PBMC may yield slightly more consistent results than shipped whole blood. Analysis, particularly gating, is a significant source of variability, and can be reduced by centralized analysis and/or use of a standardized dynamic gating template. Use of pre-aliquoted lyophilized reagents for stimulation and staining can provide further standardization to these assays.},

@article{Lutz1997,
abstract = {Based on parameters governing promoter activity and using regulatory elements of the lac, ara and tet operon transcription control sequences were composed which permit the regulation in Escherichia coli of several gene activities independently and quantitatively. The novel promoter PLtetO-1 allows the regulation of gene expression over an up to 5000-fold range with anhydrotetracycline (aTc) whereas with IPTG and arabinose the activity of Plac/ara-1 may be controlled 1800-fold. Escherichia coli host strains which produce defined amounts of the regulatory proteins, Lac and Tet repressor as well as AraC from chromosomally located expression units provide highly reproducible in vivo conditions. Controlling the expression of the genes encoding luciferase, the low abundance E.coli protein DnaJ and restriction endonuclease Cfr9I not only demonstrates that high levels of expression can be achieved but also suggests that under conditions of optimal repression only around one mRNA every 3rd generation is produced. This potential of quantitative control will open up new approaches in the study of gene function in vivo, in particular with low abundance regulatory gene products. The system will also provide new opportunities for the controlled expression of heterologous genes.},

@article{Marzen2013,
abstract = {The 50th anniversary of the classic Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model provides an opportunity to survey the broader conceptual and quantitative implications of this quintessential biophysical model. With the use of statistical mechanics, the mathematical implementation of the MWC concept links problems that seem otherwise to have no ostensible biological connection including ligand-receptor binding, ligand-gated ion channels, chemotaxis, chromatin structure and gene regulation. Hence, a thorough mathematical analysis of the MWC model can illuminate the performance limits of a number of unrelated biological systems in one stroke. The goal of our review is twofold. First, we describe in detail the general physical principles that are used to derive the activity of MWC molecules as a function of their regulatory ligands. Second, we illustrate the power of ideas from information theory and dynamical systems for quantifying how well the output of MWC molecules tracks their sensory input, giving a sense of the "design" constraints faced by these receptors. ?? 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ever since the integration of Mendelian genetics into evolutionary biology in the early 20th century, evolutionary geneticists have for the most part treated genes and mutations as generic entities. However, recent observations indicate that all genes are not equal in the eyes of evolution. Evolutionarily relevant mutations tend to accumulate in hotspot genes and at specific positions within genes. Genetic evolution is constrained by gene function, the structure of genetic networks, and population biology. The genetic basis of evolution may be predictable to some extent, and further understanding of this predictability requires incorporation of the specific functions and characteristics of genes into evolutionary theory.},

abstract = {Filter-binding and gel mobility shift assays were used to analyse the kinetics of the interaction of Lac repressor with lac operator. A comparison of the two techniques reveals that filter-binding assays with tetrameric Lac repressor have often been misinterpreted. It has been assumed that all complexes of Lac repressor and lac operator DNA bind with equal affinity to nitrocellulose filters. This assumption is wrong. Sandwich or loop complexes where two lac operators bind to one tetrameric Lac repressor are not or are only badly retained on nitrocellulose filters under normal conditions. Taking this into account, dimeric and tetrameric Lac repressor do not show any DNA-length dependence of their association and dissociation rate constants when they bind to DNA fragments smaller than 2455 base-pairs carrying a single symmetric ideal lac operator. A ninefold increased association rate to ideal lac operator on ?? DNA is observed for tetrameric but not dimeric Lac repressor. It is presumably due to intersegment transfer involving lac operator-like sequences. ?? 1992.},

Thermodynamic models are based on the assumption that the level of gene expression is proportional to the equilibrium probability that RNA polymerase (RNAP) is bound to the promoter of interest. Statistical mechanics provides a framework for computing these probabilities. Within this framework, interactions of activators, repressors, helper molecules and RNAP are described by a single function, the ‘regulation factor'. This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell.},

Thermodynamic models provide a useful framework for the quantitative analysis of bacterial transcription regulation. This framework can facilitate the quantification of vastly different forms of gene expression from several well-characterized bacterial promoters that are regulated by one or two species of transcription factors; it is useful because it requires only a few parameters. As such, it provides a compact description useful for higher-level studies (e.g. of genetic networks) without the need to invoke the biochemical details of every component.

abstract = {The goal of systems biology is to understand the behavior of the whole in terms of knowledge of the parts. This is hard to achieve in many cases due to the difficulty of characterizing the many constituents involved in a biological system and their complex web of interactions. The lac promoter of Escherichia coli offers the possibility of confronting "system-level" properties of transcriptional regulation with the known biochemistry of the molecular constituents and their mutual interactions. Such confrontations can reveal previously unknown constituents and interactions, as well as offer insight into how the components work together as a whole. Here we study the combinatorial control of the lac promoter by the regulators Lac repressor (LacR) and cAMP-receptor protein (CRP). A previous in vivo study [Setty Y, Mayo AE, Surette MG, Alon U (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7702-7707] found gross disagreement between the observed promoter activities and the expected behavior based on the known molecular mechanisms. We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP.},

abstract = {Lactose repressor (LacI) is one of the best studied prokaryotic transcriptional regulatory proteins till date. Detailed structural, biochemical and genetic studies are being carried out on LacI since four decades to understand its ligand binding properties and the basis of allosteric response. We applied directed evolution methods on LacI to generate mutants with altered allosteric properties. After testing several hosts and expression vectors, a robust expression and screening system was optimised for identifying LacI variants with altered allosteric properties. After two rounds of error prone PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and shuffling, four mutants were selected from several thousand mutants, for their ability to induce reporter gene expression at 1 microM of isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The observed combination of mutations in these four improved LacIs was not reported earlier. The mutant Lac repressors seem to operate as very good molecular switches by inducing gene expression at 1 microM of IPTG and confer 2-10 times higher level of gene expression as compared with the WT (wild -type).},

abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is an essential component of all metabolic pathways. At the most basic level, a protein binds to a particular DNA sequence (operator) on the genome and either positively or negatively alters the level of transcription. Together, the protein and its operator form an epigenetic switch that regulates gene expression. In an effort to produce a 'better' switch, we have discovered novel facets of the lac operon that are responsible for optimal functionality. We have uncovered a relationship between operator binding affinity and inducibility and demonstrated that the operator DNA is not a passive component of a genetic switch; it is responsible for establishing binding affinity, specificity as well as translational efficiency. In addition, an operator's directionality can indirectly affect gene expression. Unraveling the basic properties of this classical epigenetic switch demonstrates that multiple factors must be optimized in designing a better switch.},

@article{Goeddel1977,
abstract = {The nitrocellulose filter assay was used to study the interactions of wild-type (SQ) and tight-binding (QX86) lac repressors with synthetic lac operators 21 and 26 base pairs long. The repressor binding properties of both operators were very similar, indicating that both contain the same specific repressor recognition sites. The repressor-operator association rate constants (k(a)) were more sensitive than dissociation rate constants (k(d)) to changes in ionic strength. The responses of both k(a) and k(d) to ionic strength were relatively small compared to the effects previously observed with lambdah80dlac as operator DNA. These results suggest that under natural conditions there are electrostatic interactions between lac repressor and DNA regions outside of the 26 base pair operator sequence. Association rate constants for SQ repressor with either operator are higher than have been predicted for diffusion-limited reactions. We postulate that long-range electrostatic attractions between repressor and operator accelerate the association reaction. The presence of nonoperator DNA decreased association rate constants, the effect being more noticeable at an ionic strength of 0.05 M than at 0.20 M. Nonoperator DNA reduced k(a) values for associations involving QX86 repressor to a greater extent than for those with SQ repressor. The two types of repressors also had different rate constants for interactions with synthetic operators. The values for k(a) and k(d) were both higher with SQ repressor than with QX86 repressor. However, the rate constants were more sensitive to ionic strength when the repressor used was QX86.},

abstract = {The lactose repressor protein has been modified with three sulfhydryl-specific reagents which form mixed disulfide adducts. Methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) completely reacted with all three cysteine residues, whereas only partial reaction was observed with didansylcystine. Cysteines-107 and -140 reacted stoichiometrically with MMTS and DTNB, while Cys-281 was modified only at higher molar ratios. Didansylcystine reacted primarily with cysteines-107 and -140. Affinity of MMTS-modified repressor for 40 base pair operator DNA was decreased 30-fold compared to unmodified repressor, and this decrease correlated with modification of cysteine-281. DTNB-modified repressor bound operator DNA with a 50-fold weaker affinity than unmodified repressor. Modification of the lac repressor with didanylcystine decreased operator binding only 4-fold, and nonspecific DNA binding increased 3-fold compared to unmodified repressor. No change in the inducer equilibrium binding constant was observed following modification with any of these reagents. In contrast, inducer association and dissociation rate constants were decreased approximately 50-fold for repressor completely modified with MMTS or DTNB, while didansylcystine had minimal effect on inducer binding kinetics. Correlation between modification of Cys-281 and the observed decrease in rate constants indicates that this region of the protein regulates the accessibility of the sugar binding site. The parallel between the increase in the Kd for repressor binding to operator, the altered rate constant for inducer binding, and modification of cysteine-281 suggests that this region of the protein is crucially involved in the function of the repressor protein.},

Five variants were generated, three variants (C4, C32 and C80) with wild-type like function and two co-repressor variants (C101 and C140) that are functionally inverted. To better resolve the residues that define new allosteric networks in the LacI variants, we conducted mutational tolerance analysis via saturation mutagenesis at each of the evolved positions to assess sensitivity to mutation-a hallmark of allosteric residues. To better understand the physicochemical bases of alternate allosteric function, variant LacIC80 was characterized to assess IPTG ligand binding at equilibrium, kinetically using stopped-flow, and via isothermal titration calorimetry. These data suggest that the conferred modulated DNA binding function observed for LacIC80, while thermodynamically similar to wild-type LacI, is mechanistically different from the wild-type repressor, suggesting a new allosteric network and communication route.},

abstract = {The vast majority of biologists engaged in evolutionary studies interpret virtually every aspect of biodiversity in adaptive terms. This narrow view of evolution has become untenable in light of recent observations from genomic sequencing and population-genetic theory. Numerous aspects of genomic architecture, gene structure, and developmental pathways are difficult to explain without invoking the nonadaptive forces of genetic drift and mutation. In addition, emergent biological features such as complexity, modularity, and evolvability, all of which are current targets of considerable speculation, may be nothing more than indirect by-products of processes operating at lower levels of organization. These issues are examined in the context of the view that the origins of many aspects of biological diversity, from gene-structural embellishments to novelties at the phenotypic level, have roots in nonadaptive processes, with the population-genetic environment imposing strong directionality on the paths that are open to evolutionary exploitation.},

abstract = {The characteristics of inducer binding to lactose repressor protein in the presence of a small (29 base pair) operator DNA fragment have been examined. The presence of operator DNA fragments decreases the affinity of the protein for inducer molecules. The maximum change observed is a 20-fold increase in the concentration of inducer necessary for half-saturation of the protein. The non-linearity of the Scatchard type plots and slopes of the Hill plots of the binding data indicate that inducer binding exhibits cooperative behavior in the presence of operator DNA fragments, while free repressor binds inducer in a noncooperative fashion. The experimental data for the binding of inducer to repressor both in the presence and absence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments were compared to curves predicted by several different models. Using the limits placed by the measured values for repressor-operator DNA-inducer interaction, it was possible to discriminate between the various models. The models which accurately predicted the inducer binding curves and conformed to the measured values for the other parameters were Monod-Wyman-Changeux and Koshland type models with the following features: 1) positive cooperativity in the binding of inducer to the repressor . operator DNA complex; 2) two sites for the binding of the operator DNA fragment to repressor protein; 3) effect of binding of each operator DNA fragment on all four subunits of the repressor. These models are consistent with all of the available data, and they indicate that the binding of the first two inducer molecules accounts for greater than or equal to 60{\%} of the difference in affinities between free and induced repressor for operator DNA; in vivo this difference should be sufficient for induction to occur.},

abstract = {The proteins associated with gene regulation are often shared between multiple pathways simultaneously. By way of contrast, models in regulatory biology often assume these pathways act independently. We demonstrate a framework for calculating the change in gene expression for the interacting case by decoupling repressor occupancy across the cell from the gene of interest by way of a chemical potential. The details of the interacting regulatory architecture are encompassed in an effective concentration, and thus, a single scaling function describes a collection of gene expression data from diverse regulatory situations and collapses it onto a single master curve.},

abstract = {In vivo induction of the Escherichia coli lactose operon as a function of inducer concentration generates a sigmoidal curve, indicating a non-linear response. Suggested explanations for this dependence include a 2:1 inducer-repressor stoichiometry of induction, which is the currently accepted view. It is, however, known for decades that, in vitro, operator binding as a function of inducer concentration is not sigmoidal. This discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro data has so far not been resolved. We demonstrate that the in vivo non-linearity of induction is due to cooperative repression of the wild-type lac operon through DNA loop formation. In the absence of DNA loops, in vivo induction curves are hyperbolic. In the light of this result, we re-address the question of functional molecular inducer-repressor stoichiometry in induction of the lac operon.},

abstract = {The goal of systems biology is to understand the behavior of the whole in terms of knowledge of the parts. This is hard to achieve in many cases due to the difficulty of characterizing the many constituents involved in a biological system and their complex web of interactions. The lac promoter of Escherichia coli offers the possibility of confronting "system-level" properties of transcriptional regulation with the known biochemistry of the molecular constituents and their mutual interactions. Such confrontations can reveal previously unknown constituents and interactions, as well as offer insight into how the components work together as a whole. Here we study the combinatorial control of the lac promoter by the regulators Lac repressor (LacR) and cAMP-receptor protein (CRP). A previous in vivo study [Setty Y, Mayo AE, Surette MG, Alon U (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7702-7707] found gross disagreement between the observed promoter activities and the expected behavior based on the known molecular mechanisms. We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP.},

abstract = {Abstract The recombinant production of Lac repressor (LacI) in Escherichia coli is complicated by its ubiquitous use as a regulatory element in commercially-available expression vectors and host strains. While LacI-regulated expression systems are often used to produce recombinant LacI, the product can be heterogeneous and unsuitable for some studies. Alternative approaches include using unregulated vectors which typically suffer from low yield or vectors with promoters induced by metabolically active sugars which can dilute isotope labels necessary for certain biophysical studies. Here, an optimized expression system and isolation protocol for producing various constructs of LacI is introduced which eliminates these complications. The expression vector is an adaptation of the pASK backbone wherein expression of the lacI gene is regulated by an anhydrotetracyline inducible tetA promoter and the host strain lacks the lacI gene. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are nearly 2-fold greater than those previously reported. Notably, the new expression system is also able to produce the isolated regulatory domain of LacI without co-expression of the full-length protein and without any defects in cell viability, eliminating the inconvenient requirement for strict monitoring of cell densities during pre-culturing. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are significantly greater than those previously reported. Characterization by solution {\{}NMR{\}} shows that LacI constructs produced using this expression system are highly homogenous and functionally active. },

Direct measurement, using Pt-C shadow width standards, was 9.6 +/- 0.2 nm long. Using the Steitz model, we generated a distribution of measurements and converted them into a distribution of shadow widths using gold ball standards. Direct measurement of LacR produced a narrower shadow width distribution with a larger mean size than the Steitz model predicted. Measurement along two orthogonal axes of negatively stained LacR images generated a size distribution, also converted into a shadow width distribution using the gold ball standards. Since the experimental shadow width distribution exactly matched the shadow width distribution derived theoretically from negatively stained LacR, our negative-stained images are representative of LacR's conformation in solution. Approximately 56{\%} of negatively stained LacR had a V-shaped fold around an axis orthogonal to its length, bringing the DNA binding domains of each dimer adjacent. This open end of the V binds single operator DNA. The other 44{\%} of the LacR tetramer is in the extended form with its DNA binding sites at opposite ends. Although the V-shaped conformation has a closed hinge with the dimers associated along a side, the extended open-hinged state remains important since LacR must bind two distant operator sites for full repression. Our measurements predict the normal presence of both conformations in nearly equal amounts, suggesting that both are equally active in repressing the lac operon.},

We investigated cooperative repression of the Escherichia coli lac operon by systematic conversion of its three natural operators (O1, O2 and O3) on the chromosome. We find that cooperative repression by tetrameric Lac repressor increases with both quality and proximity of the interacting operators. A short distance of 92 bp allows effective repression by two very weak operators (O3, O3). The cooperativity of lac operators is discussed in terms of a local increase of repressor concentration.

abstract = {We present here the results of a series of small-angle X-ray scattering studies aimed at understanding the role of conformational changes and structural flexibility in DNA binding and allosteric signaling in a bacterial transcription regulator, lactose repressor protein (LacI). Experiments were designed to detect possible conformational changes that occur when LacI binds either DNA or the inducer IPTG, or both. Our studies included the native LacI dimer of homodimers and a dimeric variant (R3), enabling us to probe conformational changes within the homodimers and distinguish them from those involving changes in the homodimer-homodimer relationships. The scattering data indicate that removal of operator DNA (oDNA) from R3 results in an unfolding and extension of the hinge helix that connects the LacI regulatory and DNA-binding domains. In contrast, only very subtle conformational changes occur in the R3 dimer-oDNA complex upon IPTG binding, indicative of small adjustments in the orientations of domains and/or subdomains within the structure. The binding of IPTG to native (tetrameric) LacI-oDNA complexes also appears to facilitate a modest change in the average homodimer-homodimer disposition. Notably, the crystal structure of the native LacI-oDNA complex differs significantly from the average solution conformation. The solution scattering data are best fit by an ensemble of structures that includes (1) ??? 60{\%} of the V-shaped dimer of homodimers observed in the crystal structure and (2) ??? 40{\%} of molecules with more "open" forms, such as those generated when the homodimers move with respect to each other about the tetramerization domain. In gene regulation, such a flexible LacI would be beneficial for the interaction of its two DNA-binding domains, positioned at the tips of the V, with the required two of three LacI operators needed for full repression. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The lactose repressor protein (LacI) was among the very first genetic regulatory proteins discovered, and more than 1000 members of the bacterial LacI/GalR family are now identified. LacI has been the prototype for understanding how transcription is controlled using small metabolites to modulate protein association with specific DNA sites. This understanding has been greatly expanded by the study of other LacI/GalR homologues. A general picture emerges in which the conserved fold provides a scaffold for multiple types of interactions - including oligomerization, small molecule binding, and protein-protein binding - that in turn influence target DNA binding and thereby regulate mRNA production. Although many different functions have evolved from this basic scaffold, each homologue retains functional flexibility: For the same protein, different small molecules can have disparate impact on DNA binding and hence transcriptional outcome. In turn, binding to alternative DNA sequences may impact the degree of allosteric response. Thus, this family exhibits a symphony of variations by which transcriptional control is achieved. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Using measured kinetic constants for the lac repressor the contribution of population selection vs. induced dissociation is quantified by simulating the kinetics of allostery. At very low inducer concentration, both mechanisms contribute significantly. Total induction, though, is small under these conditions.

abstract = {Molecular recognition is central to all biological processes. For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

Using the Steitz model, we generated a distribution of measurements and converted them into a distribution of shadow widths using gold ball standards. Direct measurement of LacR produced a narrower shadow width distribution with a larger mean size than the Steitz model predicted. Measurement along two orthogonal axes of negatively stained LacR images generated a size distribution, also converted into a shadow width distribution using the gold ball standards. Since the experimental shadow width distribution exactly matched the shadow width distribution derived theoretically from negatively stained LacR, our negative-stained images are representative of LacR's conformation in solution. Approximately 56{\%} of negatively stained LacR had a V-shaped fold around an axis orthogonal to its length, bringing the DNA binding domains of each dimer adjacent. This open end of the V binds single operator DNA. The other 44{\%} of the LacR tetramer is in the extended form with its DNA binding sites at opposite ends. Although the V-shaped conformation has a closed hinge with the dimers associated along a side, the extended open-hinged state remains important since LacR must bind two distant operator sites for full repression. Our measurements predict the normal presence of both conformations in nearly equal amounts, suggesting that both are equally active in repressing the lac operon.},

abstract = {The lactose (lac) repressor is an allosteric protein that can respond to environmental changes. Mutations introduced into the DNA binding domain and the effector binding pocket affect the repressor's ability to respond to its environment. We have demonstrated how the observed phenotype is a consequence of altering the thermodynamic equilibrium constants. We discuss mutant repressors, which (1) show tighter repression; (2) induce with a previously noninducing species, orthonitrophenyl-$\beta$-d-galactoside; and (3) transform an inducible switch to one that is corepressed. The ability of point mutations to change multiple thermodynamic constants, and hence drastically alter the repressor's phenotype, shows how allosteric proteins can perform a wide array of similar yet distinct functions such as that exhibited in the Lac/Gal family of bacterial repressors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Perhaps surprisingly, one of the theoretical tools that has been used with great success on problems ranging from how cells communicate with their environment and each other to the nature of the organization of proteins and lipids within the cell membrane is statistical mechanics. A knee-jerk reaction to the use of statistical mechanics in the description of cellular processes is that living organisms are so far from equilibrium that one has no business even thinking about it. But such reactions are probably too hasty given that there are many regimes in which, because of a separation of timescales, for example, such an approach can be a useful first step.

abstract = {One of the paramount goals of synthetic biology is to have the ability to tune transcriptional networks to targeted levels of expression at will. As a step in that direction, we have constructed a set of 18 unique binding sites for E. coli RNA Polymerase (RNAP) $\delta$⁷⁰ holoenzyme, designed using a model of sequence-dependent binding energy combined with a thermodynamic model of transcription to produce a targeted level of gene expression. This promoter set allows us to determine the correspondence between the absolute numbers of mRNA molecules or protein products and the predicted promoter binding energies measured in k(B)T energy units. These binding sites adhere on average to the predicted level of gene expression over 3 orders of magnitude in constitutive gene expression, to within a factor of 3 in both protein and mRNA copy number. With these promoters in hand, we then place them under the regulatory control of a bacterial repressor and show that again there is a strict correspondence between the measured and predicted levels of expression, demonstrating the transferability of the promoters to an alternate regulatory context. In particular, our thermodynamic model predicts the expression from our promoters under a range of repressor concentrations between several per cell up to over 100 per cell. After correcting the predicted polymerase binding strength using the data from the unregulated promoter, the thermodynamic model accurately predicts the expression for the simple repression strains to within 30{\%}. Demonstration of modular promoter design, where parts of the circuit (such as RNAP/TF binding strength and transcription factor copy number) can be independently chosen from a stock list and combined to give a predictable result, has important implications as an engineering tool for use in synthetic biology.},

A comparison of the two techniques reveals that filter-binding assays with tetrameric Lac repressor have often been misinterpreted. It has been assumed that all complexes of Lac repressor and lac operator DNA bind with equal affinity to nitrocellulose filters. This assumption is wrong. Sandwich or loop complexes where two lac operators bind to one tetrameric Lac repressor are not or are only badly retained on nitrocellulose filters under normal conditions. Taking this into account, dimeric and tetrameric Lac repressor do not show any DNA-length dependence of their association and dissociation rate constants when they bind to DNA fragments smaller than 2455 base-pairs carrying a single symmetric ideal lac operator. A ninefold increased association rate to ideal lac operator on ?? DNA is observed for tetrameric but not dimeric Lac repressor. It is presumably due to intersegment transfer involving lac operator-like sequences. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Two-component systems, which are comprised of a single histidine-aspartate phosphotransfer module, are the dominant signaling pathways in bacteria and have recently been identified in several eukaryotic organisms as well. A tandem connection of two or more histidine-aspartate motifs forms complex phosphorelays. While response regulators from simple two-component systems have been characterized structurally in their inactive and active forms, we address here the question of whether a response regulator from a phosphorelay has a distinct structural basis of activation. We report the NMR solution structure of BeF3−-activated Spo0F, the first structure of a response regulator from a phosphorelay in its activated state. Conformational changes were found in regions previously identified to change in simple two-component systems. In addition, a downward shift by half a helical turn in helix 1, located on the opposite side of the common activation surface, was observed as a consequence of BeF3− activation. Conformational changes in helix 1 can be rationalized by the distinct function of phosphoryl transfer to the second histidine kinase, Spo0B, because helix 1 is known to interact directly with Spo0B and the phosphatase RapB. The identification of structural rearrangements in Spo0F supports the hypothesis of a pre-existing equilibrium between the inactive and active state prior to phosphorylation that was suggested on the basis of previous NMR dynamics studies on Spo0F. A shift of a pre-existing equilibrium is likely a general feature of response regulators.},

abstract = {Molecular recognition is central to all biological processes. For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

At the most basic level, a protein binds to a particular DNA sequence (operator) on the genome and either positively or negatively alters the level of transcription. Together, the protein and its operator form an epigenetic switch that regulates gene expression. In an effort to produce a 'better' switch, we have discovered novel facets of the lac operon that are responsible for optimal functionality. We have uncovered a relationship between operator binding affinity and inducibility and demonstrated that the operator DNA is not a passive component of a genetic switch; it is responsible for establishing binding affinity, specificity as well as translational efficiency. In addition, an operator's directionality can indirectly affect gene expression. Unraveling the basic properties of this classical epigenetic switch demonstrates that multiple factors must be optimized in designing a better switch.},

The allosteric response found in the lactose repressor and many other proteins has been extended to a variety of cellular signaling pathways in all organisms. These two models have shaped our view of modern molecular biology and captivated the attention of a surprisingly broad range of scientists. More recently, the lactose repressor monomer was used as a model system for experimental and theoretical explorations of protein folding mechanisms.

We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP.},

In the embryonic brain, RECK is specifically expressed in Nestin-positive neural precursor cells (NPCs). Reck-deficient NPCs undergo precocious differentiation that is associated with downregulated Nestin expression, impaired Notch signaling and defective self-renewal. These phenotypes were substantially rescued either by enhancing Notch signaling or by suppressing endogenous ADAM10 activity. Consequently, we found that RECK regulates the ectodomain shedding of Notch ligands by directly inhibiting the proteolytic activity of ADAM10. This mechanism appeared to be essential for Notch ligands to properly induce Notch signaling in neighboring cells. These findings indicate that RECK is a physiological inhibitor of ADAM10, an upstream regulator of Notch signaling and a critical modulator of brain development.},

abstract = {Binding of the Lac repressor to its operator DNA controls the expression of the genes of the lac operon of Escherichia coli. Lac repressor's affinity for the lac operator is diminished by an inducer that affects the structure of the repressor tetramer. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the mutant Lac repressor i-t gene, whose product, the LacR-t repressor, shows a higher affinity for the inducer isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and a lower affinity for the lac operator than the wild-type repressor. We show that the altered phenotype is due to a single amino acid residue replacement; the alanine residue at position 110 in the wild-type is replaced by threonine in i-t. Other amino acid residues in position 110 have been shown to result in an i-s phenotype. For the i-s-substitution of alanine 110 with lysine we demonstrate an increase in the affinity for operator DNA and a decrease in the affinity for IPTG. Thus, A110--{\textgreater} K shows the opposite effect to A110--{\textgreater}T on the repressor protein. We explain the phenotype of the LacR mutants by displacements of the conformational equilibrium for the dimeric repressor unit between RR (high operator affinity, low inducer affinity) and R*R* (low operator affinity, high inducer affinity) towards R*R* in the i-t and towards RR in the i-s mutant in position 110 with respect to the wild-type. The putative structures of the wild-type and mutant Lac repressors confirm this conclusion.},

Here we study the combinatorial control of the lac promoter by the regulators Lac repressor (LacR) and cAMP-receptor protein (CRP). A previous in vivo study [Setty Y, Mayo AE, Surette MG, Alon U (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7702-7707] found gross disagreement between the observed promoter activities and the expected behavior based on the known molecular mechanisms. We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative case study of transcriptional regulation in which we carry out a systematic dialogue between theory and measurement for an important and ubiquitous regulatory motif in bacteria, namely, that of simple repression. This architecture is realized by a single repressor binding site overlapping the promoter. From the theory point of view, this motif is described by a single gene regulation function based upon only a few parameters that are convenient theoretically and accessible experimentally. The usual approach is turned on its side by using the mathematical description of these regulatory motifs as a predictive tool to determine the number of repressors in a collection of strains with a large variation in repressor copy number. The predictions and corresponding measurements are carried out over a large dynamic range in both expression fold change (spanning nearly four orders of magnitude) and repressor copy number (spanning about two orders of magnitude). The predictions are tested by measuring the resulting level of gene expression and are then validated by using quantitative immunoblots. The key outcomes of this study include a systematic quantitative analysis of the limits and validity of the input-output relation for simple repression, a precise determination of the in vivo binding energies for DNA-repressor interactions for several distinct repressor binding sites, and a repressor census for Lac repressor in Escherichia coli.},

Suggested explanations for this dependence include a 2:1 inducer-repressor stoichiometry of induction, which is the currently accepted view. It is, however, known for decades that, in vitro, operator binding as a function of inducer concentration is not sigmoidal. This discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro data has so far not been resolved. We demonstrate that the in vivo non-linearity of induction is due to cooperative repression of the wild-type lac operon through DNA loop formation. In the absence of DNA loops, in vivo induction curves are hyperbolic. In the light of this result, we re-address the question of functional molecular inducer-repressor stoichiometry in induction of the lac operon.},

abstract = {The lactose repressor protein (LacI) was among the very first genetic regulatory proteins discovered, and more than 1000 members of the bacterial LacI/GalR family are now identified. LacI has been the prototype for understanding how transcription is controlled using small metabolites to modulate protein association with specific DNA sites. This understanding has been greatly expanded by the study of other LacI/GalR homologues. A general picture emerges in which the conserved fold provides a scaffold for multiple types of interactions - including oligomerization, small molecule binding, and protein-protein binding - that in turn influence target DNA binding and thereby regulate mRNA production. Although many different functions have evolved from this basic scaffold, each homologue retains functional flexibility: For the same protein, different small molecules can have disparate impact on DNA binding and hence transcriptional outcome. In turn, binding to alternative DNA sequences may impact the degree of allosteric response. Thus, this family exhibits a symphony of variations by which transcriptional control is achieved. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Among these techniques, NMR spectroscopy has played a major role given its unique near-atomic resolution and sensitivity to the dynamics that underlie allosteric couplings. Here, we highlight recent progress in the NMR methods tailored to investigate allostery with the goal of offering an overview of which NMR approaches are best suited for which allosterically relevant questions.

The structures of the apo repressor and the repressor bound to effector molecules are compared in atomic detail. All effectors examined here bind to the repressor in the same location and are anchored to the repressor through hydrogen bonds to several hydroxyl groups of the sugar ring. Inducer molecules form a more extensive hydrogen-bonding network compared to anti-inducers and neutral effector molecules. The structures of these effector molecules suggest that the O6 hydroxyl on the galactoside is essential for establishing a water-mediated hydrogen bonding network that bridges the N-terminal and C-terminal sub-domains. The altered hydrogen bonding can account in part for the different structural conformations of the repressor, and is vital for the allosteric transition. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The nitrocellulose filter assay was used to study the interactions of wild-type (SQ) and tight-binding (QX86) lac repressors with synthetic lac operators 21 and 26 base pairs long. The repressor binding properties of both operators were very similar, indicating that both contain the same specific repressor recognition sites. The repressor-operator association rate constants (k(a)) were more sensitive than dissociation rate constants (k(d)) to changes in ionic strength. The responses of both k(a) and k(d) to ionic strength were relatively small compared to the effects previously observed with lambdah80dlac as operator DNA. These results suggest that under natural conditions there are electrostatic interactions between lac repressor and DNA regions outside of the 26 base pair operator sequence. Association rate constants for SQ repressor with either operator are higher than have been predicted for diffusion-limited reactions. We postulate that long-range electrostatic attractions between repressor and operator accelerate the association reaction. The presence of nonoperator DNA decreased association rate constants, the effect being more noticeable at an ionic strength of 0.05 M than at 0.20 M. Nonoperator DNA reduced k(a) values for associations involving QX86 repressor to a greater extent than for those with SQ repressor. The two types of repressors also had different rate constants for interactions with synthetic operators. The values for k(a) and k(d) were both higher with SQ repressor than with QX86 repressor. However, the rate constants were more sensitive to ionic strength when the repressor used was QX86.},

The association rate is decreased from 4.6 x 10(4) M-1S-1 to 1.0 x 10(4) M-1S-1 by the presence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments. The inducer dissociation rate was measured by dilution of repressor . operator . inducer complexes and by displacement of the sugar molecule from repressor by the binding of operator DNA. The value for the dissociation rate in the presence of bound DNA was 0.8 S-1; this is 4-fold greater than the inducer dissociation rate measured in the absence of operator. These kinetic results suggest that repressor should exhibit a 20-fold lower affinity for inducer when operator DNA fragments are bound; this prediction is in agreement with previous equilibrium measurements. Measurement of the rate of operator fragment dissociation from repressor using a nitrocellulose filter assay yields a value of 0.04 S-1 in the absence of inducer; this dissociation rate is too rapid to measure in the presence of bound inducer molecules. Calculations assuming that the DNA-protein association rate is unaffected by sugar binding suggest that the rate of dissociation of DNA from repressor containing 4 bound inducer molecules may be as high as 40 S-1. Determination of the apparent association rate for inducer binding to operator DNA fragments indicates that DNA molecules do dissociate from the protein . operator . inducer complex at intermediate stages during the sugar binding reaction. The exact point at which dissociation occurs at a complex function of the concentrations of operator and inducer and the relationship between the rates for sugar binding and for operator fragment dissociation which are comparable for some of the protein species.},

Using a thermodynamic model, we characterize the interplay between TF copy number and the demand for that TF. We demonstrate the parameter-free predictive power of this model as a function of the copy number of the TF and the number and affinities of the available specific binding sites; such predictive control is important for the understanding of transcription and the desire to quantitatively design the output of genetic circuits.

abstract = {Abstract The recombinant production of Lac repressor (LacI) in Escherichia coli is complicated by its ubiquitous use as a regulatory element in commercially-available expression vectors and host strains. While LacI-regulated expression systems are often used to produce recombinant LacI, the product can be heterogeneous and unsuitable for some studies. Alternative approaches include using unregulated vectors which typically suffer from low yield or vectors with promoters induced by metabolically active sugars which can dilute isotope labels necessary for certain biophysical studies. Here, an optimized expression system and isolation protocol for producing various constructs of LacI is introduced which eliminates these complications. The expression vector is an adaptation of the pASK backbone wherein expression of the lacI gene is regulated by an anhydrotetracyline inducible tetA promoter and the host strain lacks the lacI gene. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are nearly 2-fold greater than those previously reported. Notably, the new expression system is also able to produce the isolated regulatory domain of LacI without co-expression of the full-length protein and without any defects in cell viability, eliminating the inconvenient requirement for strict monitoring of cell densities during pre-culturing. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are significantly greater than those previously reported. Characterization by solution {\{}NMR{\}} shows that LacI constructs produced using this expression system are highly homogenous and functionally active. },

After testing several hosts and expression vectors, a robust expression and screening system was optimised for identifying LacI variants with altered allosteric properties. After two rounds of error prone PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and shuffling, four mutants were selected from several thousand mutants, for their ability to induce reporter gene expression at 1 microM of isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The observed combination of mutations in these four improved LacIs was not reported earlier.

Distance in this space is a measure of how distinguishable two models are based on their predictions. Sloppy model manifolds are bounded with a hierarchy of widths and extrinsic curvatures. The manifold boundary approximation can extract the simple, hidden theory from complicated sloppy models. We attribute the success of simple effective models in physics as likewise emerging from complicated processes exhibiting a low effective dimensionality. We discuss the ramifications and consequences of sloppy models for biochemistry and science more generally.

This natural variability in populations fuels many fundamental biological processes, ranging from evolutionary adaptation and speciation to the spread of genetic diseases and drug resistance. An interesting and important component of this variability is present within the regulatory regions of genes. As these regions evolve, accumulated mutations lead to modulation of gene expression, which may have consequences for the phenotype. A simple model system where the link between genetic variability, gene regulation and function can be studied in detail is missing. In this article we develop a model to explore how the sequence of the wild-type lac promoter dictates the fold-change in gene expression. The model combines single-base pair resolution maps of transcription factor and RNA polymerase binding energies with a comprehensive thermodynamic model of gene regulation. The model was validated by predicting and then measuring the variability of lac operon regulation in a collection of natural isolates. We then implement the model to analyze the sensitivity of the promoter sequence to the regulatory output, and predict the potential for regulation to evolve due to point mutations in the promoter region.},

We find that cooperative repression by tetrameric Lac repressor increases with both quality and proximity of the interacting operators.

Recent publications have disclosed the role of pre-existing equilibria of conformational substates in this process. In addition, the role of dynamics as an entropic carrier of free energy of allostery has been investigated. Recent work thus shows that dynamics is pivotal to allostery, and that it constitutes much more than just the move from the ‘T'-state to the ‘R'-state. Emerging computational studies have described the actual pathways of allosteric change.},
