abstract = {The ability to regulate gene expression is of central importance for the adaptability of living organisms to changes in their external and internal environment. At the transcriptional level, binding of transcription factors (TFs) in the promoter region can modulate the transcription rate, hence making TFs central players in gene regulation. For some model organisms, information about the locations and identities of discovered TF binding sites have been collected in continually updated databases, such as RegulonDB for the well-studied case of E. coli. In order to reveal the general principles behind the binding-site arrangement and function of these regulatory architectures we propose a random promoter architecture model that preserves the overall abundance of binding sites to identify overrepresented binding site configurations. This model is analogous to the random network model used in the study of genetic network motifs, where regulatory motifs are identified through their overrepresentation with respect to a "randomly connected" genetic network. Using our model we identify TF pairs which coregulate operons in an overrepresented fashion, or individual TFs which act at multiple binding sites per promoter by, for example, cooperative binding, DNA looping, or through multiple binding domains. We furthermore explore the relationship between promoter architecture and gene expression, using three different genome-wide protein copy number censuses. Perhaps surprisingly, we find no systematic correlation between the number of activator and repressor binding sites regulating a gene and the level of gene expression. A position-weight-matrix model used to estimate the binding affinity of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to the promoters of activated and repressed genes suggests that this lack of correlation might in part be due to differences in basal transcription levels, with repressed genes having a higher basal activity level. This quantitative catalogue relating promoter architecture and function provides a first step towards genome-wide predictive models of regulatory function.},

abstract = {The expression of genes is regularly characterized with respect to how much, how fast, when and where. Such quantitative data demands quantitative models. Thermodynamic models are based on the assumption that the level of gene expression is proportional to the equilibrium probability that RNA polymerase (RNAP) is bound to the promoter of interest. Statistical mechanics provides a framework for computing these probabilities. Within this framework, interactions of activators, repressors, helper molecules and RNAP are described by a single function, the 'regulation factor'. This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The lac operon is a model system for understanding how effector molecules regulate transcription and are necessary for allosteric transitions. The crystal structures of the lac repressor bound to inducer and anti-inducer molecules provide a model for how these small molecules can modulate repressor function. The structures of the apo repressor and the repressor bound to effector molecules are compared in atomic detail. All effectors examined here bind to the repressor in the same location and are anchored to the repressor through hydrogen bonds to several hydroxyl groups of the sugar ring. Inducer molecules form a more extensive hydrogen-bonding network compared to anti-inducers and neutral effector molecules. The structures of these effector molecules suggest that the O6 hydroxyl on the galactoside is essential for establishing a water-mediated hydrogen bonding network that bridges the N-terminal and C-terminal sub-domains. The altered hydrogen bonding can account in part for the different structural conformations of the repressor, and is vital for the allosteric transition. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract The recombinant production of Lac repressor (LacI) in Escherichia coli is complicated by its ubiquitous use as a regulatory element in commercially-available expression vectors and host strains. While LacI-regulated expression systems are often used to produce recombinant LacI, the product can be heterogeneous and unsuitable for some studies. Alternative approaches include using unregulated vectors which typically suffer from low yield or vectors with promoters induced by metabolically active sugars which can dilute isotope labels necessary for certain biophysical studies. Here, an optimized expression system and isolation protocol for producing various constructs of LacI is introduced which eliminates these complications. The expression vector is an adaptation of the pASK backbone wherein expression of the lacI gene is regulated by an anhydrotetracyline inducible tetA promoter and the host strain lacks the lacI gene. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are nearly 2-fold greater than those previously reported. Notably, the new expression system is also able to produce the isolated regulatory domain of LacI without co-expression of the full-length protein and without any defects in cell viability, eliminating the inconvenient requirement for strict monitoring of cell densities during pre-culturing. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are significantly greater than those previously reported. Characterization by solution {\{}NMR{\}} shows that LacI constructs produced using this expression system are highly homogenous and functionally active. },

abstract = {In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, repressors and activators are responsible for regulating gene expression. The lac operon is a paradigm for understanding how metabolites function as signaling molecules and modulate transcription. These metabolites or allosteric effector molecules bind to the repressor and alter the conformational equilibrium between the induced and the repressed states. Here, we describe a set of experiments where we modified a single inducer binding site in a dimeric repressor and examined its effect on induction. Based upon these observations, we have been able to calculate the thermodynamic parameters that are responsible for the allosteric properties that govern repressor function. Understanding how effector molecules alter the thermodynamic properties of the repressor is essential for establishing a detailed understanding of gene regulation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The nitrocellulose filter assay was used to study the interactions of wild-type (SQ) and tight-binding (QX86) lac repressors with synthetic lac operators 21 and 26 base pairs long. The repressor binding properties of both operators were very similar, indicating that both contain the same specific repressor recognition sites. The repressor-operator association rate constants (k(a)) were more sensitive than dissociation rate constants (k(d)) to changes in ionic strength. The responses of both k(a) and k(d) to ionic strength were relatively small compared to the effects previously observed with lambdah80dlac as operator DNA. These results suggest that under natural conditions there are electrostatic interactions between lac repressor and DNA regions outside of the 26 base pair operator sequence. Association rate constants for SQ repressor with either operator are higher than have been predicted for diffusion-limited reactions. We postulate that long-range electrostatic attractions between repressor and operator accelerate the association reaction. The presence of nonoperator DNA decreased association rate constants, the effect being more noticeable at an ionic strength of 0.05 M than at 0.20 M. Nonoperator DNA reduced k(a) values for associations involving QX86 repressor to a greater extent than for those with SQ repressor. The two types of repressors also had different rate constants for interactions with synthetic operators. The values for k(a) and k(d) were both higher with SQ repressor than with QX86 repressor. However, the rate constants were more sensitive to ionic strength when the repressor used was QX86.},

abstract = {We tested whether the Steitz et al. [(1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 71:593-597] model of lactose repressor (LacR) (14 x 6.0 x 4.5 nm) represented the shape of free or operator-bound LacR in solution. The model predicts a 14 nm length for bound LacR. Direct measurement, using Pt-C shadow width standards, was 9.6 +/- 0.2 nm long. Using the Steitz model, we generated a distribution of measurements and converted them into a distribution of shadow widths using gold ball standards. Direct measurement of LacR produced a narrower shadow width distribution with a larger mean size than the Steitz model predicted. Measurement along two orthogonal axes of negatively stained LacR images generated a size distribution, also converted into a shadow width distribution using the gold ball standards. Since the experimental shadow width distribution exactly matched the shadow width distribution derived theoretically from negatively stained LacR, our negative-stained images are representative of LacR's conformation in solution. Approximately 56{\%} of negatively stained LacR had a V-shaped fold around an axis orthogonal to its length, bringing the DNA binding domains of each dimer adjacent. This open end of the V binds single operator DNA. The other 44{\%} of the LacR tetramer is in the extended form with its DNA binding sites at opposite ends. Although the V-shaped conformation has a closed hinge with the dimers associated along a side, the extended open-hinged state remains important since LacR must bind two distant operator sites for full repression. Our measurements predict the normal presence of both conformations in nearly equal amounts, suggesting that both are equally active in repressing the lac operon.},

Detailed structural, biochemical and genetic studies are being carried out on LacI since four decades to understand its ligand binding properties and the basis of allosteric response. We applied directed evolution methods on LacI to generate mutants with altered allosteric properties. After testing several hosts and expression vectors, a robust expression and screening system was optimised for identifying LacI variants with altered allosteric properties. After two rounds of error prone PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and shuffling, four mutants were selected from several thousand mutants, for their ability to induce reporter gene expression at 1 microM of isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The observed combination of mutations in these four improved LacIs was not reported earlier. The mutant Lac repressors seem to operate as very good molecular switches by inducing gene expression at 1 microM of IPTG and confer 2-10 times higher level of gene expression as compared with the WT (wild -type).},

abstract = {The rates of binding of inducer molecules to the lactose repressor protein are significantly affected by the presence of bound operator DNA fragments. The association rate is decreased from 4.6 x 10(4) M-1S-1 to 1.0 x 10(4) M-1S-1 by the presence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments. The inducer dissociation rate was measured by dilution of repressor . operator . inducer complexes and by displacement of the sugar molecule from repressor by the binding of operator DNA. The value for the dissociation rate in the presence of bound DNA was 0.8 S-1; this is 4-fold greater than the inducer dissociation rate measured in the absence of operator. These kinetic results suggest that repressor should exhibit a 20-fold lower affinity for inducer when operator DNA fragments are bound; this prediction is in agreement with previous equilibrium measurements. Measurement of the rate of operator fragment dissociation from repressor using a nitrocellulose filter assay yields a value of 0.04 S-1 in the absence of inducer; this dissociation rate is too rapid to measure in the presence of bound inducer molecules. Calculations assuming that the DNA-protein association rate is unaffected by sugar binding suggest that the rate of dissociation of DNA from repressor containing 4 bound inducer molecules may be as high as 40 S-1. Determination of the apparent association rate for inducer binding to operator DNA fragments indicates that DNA molecules do dissociate from the protein . operator . inducer complex at intermediate stages during the sugar binding reaction. The exact point at which dissociation occurs at a complex function of the concentrations of operator and inducer and the relationship between the rates for sugar binding and for operator fragment dissociation which are comparable for some of the protein species.},

abstract = {The characteristics of inducer binding to lactose repressor protein in the presence of a small (29 base pair) operator DNA fragment have been examined. The presence of operator DNA fragments decreases the affinity of the protein for inducer molecules. The maximum change observed is a 20-fold increase in the concentration of inducer necessary for half-saturation of the protein. The non-linearity of the Scatchard type plots and slopes of the Hill plots of the binding data indicate that inducer binding exhibits cooperative behavior in the presence of operator DNA fragments, while free repressor binds inducer in a noncooperative fashion. The experimental data for the binding of inducer to repressor both in the presence and absence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments were compared to curves predicted by several different models. Using the limits placed by the measured values for repressor-operator DNA-inducer interaction, it was possible to discriminate between the various models. The models which accurately predicted the inducer binding curves and conformed to the measured values for the other parameters were Monod-Wyman-Changeux and Koshland type models with the following features: 1) positive cooperativity in the binding of inducer to the repressor . operator DNA complex; 2) two sites for the binding of the operator DNA fragment to repressor protein; 3) effect of binding of each operator DNA fragment on all four subunits of the repressor. These models are consistent with all of the available data, and they indicate that the binding of the first two inducer molecules accounts for greater than or equal to 60{\%} of the difference in affinities between free and induced repressor for operator DNA; in vivo this difference should be sufficient for induction to occur.},

LacI has been the prototype for understanding how transcription is controlled using small metabolites to modulate protein association with specific DNA sites. This understanding has been greatly expanded by the study of other LacI/GalR homologues. A general picture emerges in which the conserved fold provides a scaffold for multiple types of interactions - including oligomerization, small molecule binding, and protein-protein binding - that in turn influence target DNA binding and thereby regulate mRNA production. Although many different functions have evolved from this basic scaffold, each homologue retains functional flexibility: For the same protein, different small molecules can have disparate impact on DNA binding and hence transcriptional outcome. In turn, binding to alternative DNA sequences may impact the degree of allosteric response.

@article{Taraban2008,
abstract = {We present here the results of a series of small-angle X-ray scattering studies aimed at understanding the role of conformational changes and structural flexibility in DNA binding and allosteric signaling in a bacterial transcription regulator, lactose repressor protein (LacI). Experiments were designed to detect possible conformational changes that occur when LacI binds either DNA or the inducer IPTG, or both. Our studies included the native LacI dimer of homodimers and a dimeric variant (R3), enabling us to probe conformational changes within the homodimers and distinguish them from those involving changes in the homodimer-homodimer relationships. The scattering data indicate that removal of operator DNA (oDNA) from R3 results in an unfolding and extension of the hinge helix that connects the LacI regulatory and DNA-binding domains. In contrast, only very subtle conformational changes occur in the R3 dimer-oDNA complex upon IPTG binding, indicative of small adjustments in the orientations of domains and/or subdomains within the structure. The binding of IPTG to native (tetrameric) LacI-oDNA complexes also appears to facilitate a modest change in the average homodimer-homodimer disposition. Notably, the crystal structure of the native LacI-oDNA complex differs significantly from the average solution conformation. The solution scattering data are best fit by an ensemble of structures that includes (1) ??? 60{\%} of the V-shaped dimer of homodimers observed in the crystal structure and (2) ??? 40{\%} of molecules with more "open" forms, such as those generated when the homodimers move with respect to each other about the tetramerization domain. In gene regulation, such a flexible LacI would be beneficial for the interaction of its two DNA-binding domains, positioned at the tips of the V, with the required two of three LacI operators needed for full repression. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The lactose repressor protein has been modified with three sulfhydryl-specific reagents which form mixed disulfide adducts. Methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) completely reacted with all three cysteine residues, whereas only partial reaction was observed with didansylcystine. Cysteines-107 and -140 reacted stoichiometrically with MMTS and DTNB, while Cys-281 was modified only at higher molar ratios. Didansylcystine reacted primarily with cysteines-107 and -140. Affinity of MMTS-modified repressor for 40 base pair operator DNA was decreased 30-fold compared to unmodified repressor, and this decrease correlated with modification of cysteine-281. DTNB-modified repressor bound operator DNA with a 50-fold weaker affinity than unmodified repressor. Modification of the lac repressor with didanylcystine decreased operator binding only 4-fold, and nonspecific DNA binding increased 3-fold compared to unmodified repressor. No change in the inducer equilibrium binding constant was observed following modification with any of these reagents. In contrast, inducer association and dissociation rate constants were decreased approximately 50-fold for repressor completely modified with MMTS or DTNB, while didansylcystine had minimal effect on inducer binding kinetics. Correlation between modification of Cys-281 and the observed decrease in rate constants indicates that this region of the protein regulates the accessibility of the sugar binding site. The parallel between the increase in the Kd for repressor binding to operator, the altered rate constant for inducer binding, and modification of cysteine-281 suggests that this region of the protein is crucially involved in the function of the repressor protein.},

abstract = {Molecular recognition is central to all biological processes. For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

We investigated cooperative repression of the Escherichia coli lac operon by systematic conversion of its three natural operators (O1, O2 and O3) on the chromosome. We find that cooperative repression by tetrameric Lac repressor increases with both quality and proximity of the interacting operators. A short distance of 92 bp allows effective repression by two very weak operators (O3, O3). The cooperativity of lac operators is discussed in terms of a local increase of repressor concentration. This increase in concentration depends on flexible DNA which allows loop formation.},

abstract = {In vivo induction of the Escherichia coli lactose operon as a function of inducer concentration generates a sigmoidal curve, indicating a non-linear response. Suggested explanations for this dependence include a 2:1 inducer-repressor stoichiometry of induction, which is the currently accepted view. It is, however, known for decades that, in vitro, operator binding as a function of inducer concentration is not sigmoidal. This discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro data has so far not been resolved. We demonstrate that the in vivo non-linearity of induction is due to cooperative repression of the wild-type lac operon through DNA loop formation. In the absence of DNA loops, in vivo induction curves are hyperbolic. In the light of this result, we re-address the question of functional molecular inducer-repressor stoichiometry in induction of the lac operon.},

abstract = {Allostery, the modulation of function of a protein at one site by the binding of a ligand at a different site, is a property of many proteins. Two kinetically distinct models have been proposed: i) The induced fit model in which the ligand binds to the protein and then induces the conformational change. ii) The population selection model, in which the protein spontaneously undergoes a conformational change, which is then 'captured' by the ligand. Using measured kinetic constants for the lac repressor the contribution of population selection vs. induced dissociation is quantified by simulating the kinetics of allostery. At very low inducer concentration, both mechanisms contribute significantly. Total induction, though, is small under these conditions. At increasing levels of induction the induced dissociation mechanism soon dominates, first due to binding of one inducer, and then from two inducers binding. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This narrow view of evolution has become untenable in light of recent observations from genomic sequencing and population-genetic theory. Numerous aspects of genomic architecture, gene structure, and developmental pathways are difficult to explain without invoking the nonadaptive forces of genetic drift and mutation. In addition, emergent biological features such as complexity, modularity, and evolvability, all of which are current targets of considerable speculation, may be nothing more than indirect by-products of processes operating at lower levels of organization. These issues are examined in the context of the view that the origins of many aspects of biological diversity, from gene-structural embellishments to novelties at the phenotypic level, have roots in nonadaptive processes, with the population-genetic environment imposing strong directionality on the paths that are open to evolutionary exploitation.},

This proposal was followed by an explication of allosteric behavior by Monod and colleagues. The operon model rationally depicted how genetic mechanisms can control metabolic events in response to environmental stimuli via coordinated transcription of a set of genes with related function (e.g. metabolism of lactose). The allosteric response found in the lactose repressor and many other proteins has been extended to a variety of cellular signaling pathways in all organisms. These two models have shaped our view of modern molecular biology and captivated the attention of a surprisingly broad range of scientists. More recently, the lactose repressor monomer was used as a model system for experimental and theoretical explorations of protein folding mechanisms. Thus, the lac system continues to advance our molecular understanding of genetic control and the relationship between sequence, structure and function.},

abstract = {Binding of the Lac repressor to its operator DNA controls the expression of the genes of the lac operon of Escherichia coli. Lac repressor's affinity for the lac operator is diminished by an inducer that affects the structure of the repressor tetramer. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the mutant Lac repressor i-t gene, whose product, the LacR-t repressor, shows a higher affinity for the inducer isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and a lower affinity for the lac operator than the wild-type repressor. We show that the altered phenotype is due to a single amino acid residue replacement; the alanine residue at position 110 in the wild-type is replaced by threonine in i-t. Other amino acid residues in position 110 have been shown to result in an i-s phenotype. For the i-s-substitution of alanine 110 with lysine we demonstrate an increase in the affinity for operator DNA and a decrease in the affinity for IPTG. Thus, A110--{\textgreater} K shows the opposite effect to A110--{\textgreater}T on the repressor protein. We explain the phenotype of the LacR mutants by displacements of the conformational equilibrium for the dimeric repressor unit between RR (high operator affinity, low inducer affinity) and R*R* (low operator affinity, high inducer affinity) towards R*R* in the i-t and towards RR in the i-s mutant in position 110 with respect to the wild-type. The putative structures of the wild-type and mutant Lac repressors confirm this conclusion.},

By way of contrast, models in regulatory biology often assume these pathways act independently. We demonstrate a framework for calculating the change in gene expression for the interacting case by decoupling repressor occupancy across the cell from the gene of interest by way of a chemical potential. The details of the interacting regulatory architecture are encompassed in an effective concentration, and thus, a single scaling function describes a collection of gene expression data from diverse regulatory situations and collapses it onto a single master curve.},

abstract = {To expand our understanding of the hallmarks of allosteric control we used directed-evolution to engineer alternate cooperative communication in the lactose repressor protein (LacI) scaffold. Starting with an I(s) type LacI mutant D88A (i.e. a LacI variant that is insensitive to the exogenous ligand isopropyl-$\beta$-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and remains bound to operator DNA, + or -IPTG) we used error-prone polymerase chain reaction to introduce compensatory mutations to restore modulated DNA binding function to the allosterically 'dead' I(s)D88A background. Five variants were generated, three variants (C4, C32 and C80) with wild-type like function and two co-repressor variants (C101 and C140) that are functionally inverted. To better resolve the residues that define new allosteric networks in the LacI variants, we conducted mutational tolerance analysis via saturation mutagenesis at each of the evolved positions to assess sensitivity to mutation-a hallmark of allosteric residues. To better understand the physicochemical bases of alternate allosteric function, variant LacIC80 was characterized to assess IPTG ligand binding at equilibrium, kinetically using stopped-flow, and via isothermal titration calorimetry. These data suggest that the conferred modulated DNA binding function observed for LacIC80, while thermodynamically similar to wild-type LacI, is mechanistically different from the wild-type repressor, suggesting a new allosteric network and communication route.},

In an effort to produce a 'better' switch, we have discovered novel facets of the lac operon that are responsible for optimal functionality. We have uncovered a relationship between operator binding affinity and inducibility and demonstrated that the operator DNA is not a passive component of a genetic switch; it is responsible for establishing binding affinity, specificity as well as translational efficiency.

abstract = {Two-component systems, which are comprised of a single histidine-aspartate phosphotransfer module, are the dominant signaling pathways in bacteria and have recently been identified in several eukaryotic organisms as well. A tandem connection of two or more histidine-aspartate motifs forms complex phosphorelays. While response regulators from simple two-component systems have been characterized structurally in their inactive and active forms, we address here the question of whether a response regulator from a phosphorelay has a distinct structural basis of activation. We report the NMR solution structure of BeF3−-activated Spo0F, the first structure of a response regulator from a phosphorelay in its activated state. Conformational changes were found in regions previously identified to change in simple two-component systems. In addition, a downward shift by half a helical turn in helix 1, located on the opposite side of the common activation surface, was observed as a consequence of BeF3− activation. Conformational changes in helix 1 can be rationalized by the distinct function of phosphoryl transfer to the second histidine kinase, Spo0B, because helix 1 is known to interact directly with Spo0B and the phosphatase RapB. The identification of structural rearrangements in Spo0F supports the hypothesis of a pre-existing equilibrium between the inactive and active state prior to phosphorylation that was suggested on the basis of previous NMR dynamics studies on Spo0F. A shift of a pre-existing equilibrium is likely a general feature of response regulators.},

abstract = {The characteristics of inducer binding to lactose repressor protein in the presence of a small (29 base pair) operator DNA fragment have been examined. The presence of operator DNA fragments decreases the affinity of the protein for inducer molecules. The maximum change observed is a 20-fold increase in the concentration of inducer necessary for half-saturation of the protein. The non-linearity of the Scatchard type plots and slopes of the Hill plots of the binding data indicate that inducer binding exhibits cooperative behavior in the presence of operator DNA fragments, while free repressor binds inducer in a noncooperative fashion. The experimental data for the binding of inducer to repressor both in the presence and absence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments were compared to curves predicted by several different models. Using the limits placed by the measured values for repressor-operator DNA-inducer interaction, it was possible to discriminate between the various models. The models which accurately predicted the inducer binding curves and conformed to the measured values for the other parameters were Monod-Wyman-Changeux and Koshland type models with the following features: 1) positive cooperativity in the binding of inducer to the repressor . operator DNA complex; 2) two sites for the binding of the operator DNA fragment to repressor protein; 3) effect of binding of each operator DNA fragment on all four subunits of the repressor. These models are consistent with all of the available data, and they indicate that the binding of the first two inducer molecules accounts for greater than or equal to 60{\%} of the difference in affinities between free and induced repressor for operator DNA; in vivo this difference should be sufficient for induction to occur.},

abstract = {The lactose repressor protein (LacI) was among the very first genetic regulatory proteins discovered, and more than 1000 members of the bacterial LacI/GalR family are now identified. LacI has been the prototype for understanding how transcription is controlled using small metabolites to modulate protein association with specific DNA sites. This understanding has been greatly expanded by the study of other LacI/GalR homologues. A general picture emerges in which the conserved fold provides a scaffold for multiple types of interactions - including oligomerization, small molecule binding, and protein-protein binding - that in turn influence target DNA binding and thereby regulate mRNA production. Although many different functions have evolved from this basic scaffold, each homologue retains functional flexibility: For the same protein, different small molecules can have disparate impact on DNA binding and hence transcriptional outcome. In turn, binding to alternative DNA sequences may impact the degree of allosteric response. Thus, this family exhibits a symphony of variations by which transcriptional control is achieved. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP.},

abstract = {We tested whether the Steitz et al. [(1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 71:593-597] model of lactose repressor (LacR) (14 x 6.0 x 4.5 nm) represented the shape of free or operator-bound LacR in solution. The model predicts a 14 nm length for bound LacR. Direct measurement, using Pt-C shadow width standards, was 9.6 +/- 0.2 nm long. Using the Steitz model, we generated a distribution of measurements and converted them into a distribution of shadow widths using gold ball standards. Direct measurement of LacR produced a narrower shadow width distribution with a larger mean size than the Steitz model predicted. Measurement along two orthogonal axes of negatively stained LacR images generated a size distribution, also converted into a shadow width distribution using the gold ball standards. Since the experimental shadow width distribution exactly matched the shadow width distribution derived theoretically from negatively stained LacR, our negative-stained images are representative of LacR's conformation in solution. Approximately 56{\%} of negatively stained LacR had a V-shaped fold around an axis orthogonal to its length, bringing the DNA binding domains of each dimer adjacent. This open end of the V binds single operator DNA. The other 44{\%} of the LacR tetramer is in the extended form with its DNA binding sites at opposite ends. Although the V-shaped conformation has a closed hinge with the dimers associated along a side, the extended open-hinged state remains important since LacR must bind two distant operator sites for full repression. Our measurements predict the normal presence of both conformations in nearly equal amounts, suggesting that both are equally active in repressing the lac operon.},

abstract = {Binding of the Lac repressor to its operator DNA controls the expression of the genes of the lac operon of Escherichia coli. Lac repressor's affinity for the lac operator is diminished by an inducer that affects the structure of the repressor tetramer. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the mutant Lac repressor i-t gene, whose product, the LacR-t repressor, shows a higher affinity for the inducer isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and a lower affinity for the lac operator than the wild-type repressor. We show that the altered phenotype is due to a single amino acid residue replacement; the alanine residue at position 110 in the wild-type is replaced by threonine in i-t. Other amino acid residues in position 110 have been shown to result in an i-s phenotype. For the i-s-substitution of alanine 110 with lysine we demonstrate an increase in the affinity for operator DNA and a decrease in the affinity for IPTG. Thus, A110--{\textgreater} K shows the opposite effect to A110--{\textgreater}T on the repressor protein. We explain the phenotype of the LacR mutants by displacements of the conformational equilibrium for the dimeric repressor unit between RR (high operator affinity, low inducer affinity) and R*R* (low operator affinity, high inducer affinity) towards R*R* in the i-t and towards RR in the i-s mutant in position 110 with respect to the wild-type. The putative structures of the wild-type and mutant Lac repressors confirm this conclusion.},

Largely because of advances in the techniques of molecular biology in the past few decades, our knowledge of regulation by most of these mechanisms has expanded enormously. Regulation by small-molecule, allosteric interactions is an exception. Many of the best-known allosteric regulators were discovered decades ago, when we knew little about all of these other forms of regulation. Allostery is the most direct, rapid, and efficient regulatory mechanism to sense changes in the concentration of small molecules and alter cellular responses to maintain homeostasis. In this perspective, we present the argument that allosteric regulation is underappreciated in the systems biology world and that many allosteric effectors remain to be discovered.},

abstract = {The nitrocellulose filter assay was used to study the interactions of wild-type (SQ) and tight-binding (QX86) lac repressors with synthetic lac operators 21 and 26 base pairs long. The repressor binding properties of both operators were very similar, indicating that both contain the same specific repressor recognition sites. The repressor-operator association rate constants (k(a)) were more sensitive than dissociation rate constants (k(d)) to changes in ionic strength. The responses of both k(a) and k(d) to ionic strength were relatively small compared to the effects previously observed with lambdah80dlac as operator DNA. These results suggest that under natural conditions there are electrostatic interactions between lac repressor and DNA regions outside of the 26 base pair operator sequence. Association rate constants for SQ repressor with either operator are higher than have been predicted for diffusion-limited reactions. We postulate that long-range electrostatic attractions between repressor and operator accelerate the association reaction. The presence of nonoperator DNA decreased association rate constants, the effect being more noticeable at an ionic strength of 0.05 M than at 0.20 M. Nonoperator DNA reduced k(a) values for associations involving QX86 repressor to a greater extent than for those with SQ repressor. The two types of repressors also had different rate constants for interactions with synthetic operators. The values for k(a) and k(d) were both higher with SQ repressor than with QX86 repressor. However, the rate constants were more sensitive to ionic strength when the repressor used was QX86.},

The association rate is decreased from 4.6 x 10(4) M-1S-1 to 1.0 x 10(4) M-1S-1 by the presence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments. The inducer dissociation rate was measured by dilution of repressor . operator . inducer complexes and by displacement of the sugar molecule from repressor by the binding of operator DNA. The value for the dissociation rate in the presence of bound DNA was 0.8 S-1; this is 4-fold greater than the inducer dissociation rate measured in the absence of operator. These kinetic results suggest that repressor should exhibit a 20-fold lower affinity for inducer when operator DNA fragments are bound; this prediction is in agreement with previous equilibrium measurements. Measurement of the rate of operator fragment dissociation from repressor using a nitrocellulose filter assay yields a value of 0.04 S-1 in the absence of inducer; this dissociation rate is too rapid to measure in the presence of bound inducer molecules. Calculations assuming that the DNA-protein association rate is unaffected by sugar binding suggest that the rate of dissociation of DNA from repressor containing 4 bound inducer molecules may be as high as 40 S-1. Determination of the apparent association rate for inducer binding to operator DNA fragments indicates that DNA molecules do dissociate from the protein . operator . inducer complex at intermediate stages during the sugar binding reaction. The exact point at which dissociation occurs at a complex function of the concentrations of operator and inducer and the relationship between the rates for sugar binding and for operator fragment dissociation which are comparable for some of the protein species.},

Among these techniques, NMR spectroscopy has played a major role given its unique near-atomic resolution and sensitivity to the dynamics that underlie allosteric couplings. Here, we highlight recent progress in the NMR methods tailored to investigate allostery with the goal of offering an overview of which NMR approaches are best suited for which allosterically relevant questions.

Many such models are "sloppy," i.e., exhibit behavior controlled by a relatively small number of parameter combinations. We review an information theoretic framework for analyzing sloppy models. This formalism is based on the Fisher information matrix, which is interpreted as a Riemannian metric on a parameterized space of models. Distance in this space is a measure of how distinguishable two models are based on their predictions. Sloppy model manifolds are bounded with a hierarchy of widths and extrinsic curvatures. The manifold boundary approximation can extract the simple, hidden theory from complicated sloppy models. We attribute the success of simple effective models in physics as likewise emerging from complicated processes exhibiting a low effective dimensionality. We discuss the ramifications and consequences of sloppy models for biochemistry and science more generally. We suggest that the reason our complex world is understandable is due to the same fundamental reason: simple theories of macroscopic behavior are hidden inside complicated microscopic processes.},

This architecture is realized by a single repressor binding site overlapping the promoter. From the theory point of view, this motif is described by a single gene regulation function based upon only a few parameters that are convenient theoretically and accessible experimentally. The usual approach is turned on its side by using the mathematical description of these regulatory motifs as a predictive tool to determine the number of repressors in a collection of strains with a large variation in repressor copy number. The predictions and corresponding measurements are carried out over a large dynamic range in both expression fold change (spanning nearly four orders of magnitude) and repressor copy number (spanning about two orders of magnitude). The predictions are tested by measuring the resulting level of gene expression and are then validated by using quantitative immunoblots. The key outcomes of this study include a systematic quantitative analysis of the limits and validity of the input-output relation for simple repression, a precise determination of the in vivo binding energies for DNA-repressor interactions for several distinct repressor binding sites, and a repressor census for Lac repressor in Escherichia coli.},

It has been assumed that all complexes of Lac repressor and lac operator DNA bind with equal affinity to nitrocellulose filters. This assumption is wrong. Sandwich or loop complexes where two lac operators bind to one tetrameric Lac repressor are not or are only badly retained on nitrocellulose filters under normal conditions. Taking this into account, dimeric and tetrameric Lac repressor do not show any DNA-length dependence of their association and dissociation rate constants when they bind to DNA fragments smaller than 2455 base-pairs carrying a single symmetric ideal lac operator. A ninefold increased association rate to ideal lac operator on ?? DNA is observed for tetrameric but not dimeric Lac repressor.

We find that cooperative repression by tetrameric Lac repressor increases with both quality and proximity of the interacting operators. A short distance of 92 bp allows effective repression by two very weak operators (O3, O3). The cooperativity of lac operators is discussed in terms of a local increase of repressor concentration.

We applied directed evolution methods on LacI to generate mutants with altered allosteric properties. After testing several hosts and expression vectors, a robust expression and screening system was optimised for identifying LacI variants with altered allosteric properties. After two rounds of error prone PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and shuffling, four mutants were selected from several thousand mutants, for their ability to induce reporter gene expression at 1 microM of isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The observed combination of mutations in these four improved LacIs was not reported earlier. The mutant Lac repressors seem to operate as very good molecular switches by inducing gene expression at 1 microM of IPTG and confer 2-10 times higher level of gene expression as compared with the WT (wild -type).},

abstract = {We present here the results of a series of small-angle X-ray scattering studies aimed at understanding the role of conformational changes and structural flexibility in DNA binding and allosteric signaling in a bacterial transcription regulator, lactose repressor protein (LacI). Experiments were designed to detect possible conformational changes that occur when LacI binds either DNA or the inducer IPTG, or both. Our studies included the native LacI dimer of homodimers and a dimeric variant (R3), enabling us to probe conformational changes within the homodimers and distinguish them from those involving changes in the homodimer-homodimer relationships. The scattering data indicate that removal of operator DNA (oDNA) from R3 results in an unfolding and extension of the hinge helix that connects the LacI regulatory and DNA-binding domains. In contrast, only very subtle conformational changes occur in the R3 dimer-oDNA complex upon IPTG binding, indicative of small adjustments in the orientations of domains and/or subdomains within the structure. The binding of IPTG to native (tetrameric) LacI-oDNA complexes also appears to facilitate a modest change in the average homodimer-homodimer disposition. Notably, the crystal structure of the native LacI-oDNA complex differs significantly from the average solution conformation. The solution scattering data are best fit by an ensemble of structures that includes (1) ??? 60{\%} of the V-shaped dimer of homodimers observed in the crystal structure and (2) ??? 40{\%} of molecules with more "open" forms, such as those generated when the homodimers move with respect to each other about the tetramerization domain. In gene regulation, such a flexible LacI would be beneficial for the interaction of its two DNA-binding domains, positioned at the tips of the V, with the required two of three LacI operators needed for full repression. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In the embryonic brain, RECK is specifically expressed in Nestin-positive neural precursor cells (NPCs). Reck-deficient NPCs undergo precocious differentiation that is associated with downregulated Nestin expression, impaired Notch signaling and defective self-renewal. These phenotypes were substantially rescued either by enhancing Notch signaling or by suppressing endogenous ADAM10 activity. Consequently, we found that RECK regulates the ectodomain shedding of Notch ligands by directly inhibiting the proteolytic activity of ADAM10. This mechanism appeared to be essential for Notch ligands to properly induce Notch signaling in neighboring cells. These findings indicate that RECK is a physiological inhibitor of ADAM10, an upstream regulator of Notch signaling and a critical modulator of brain development.},

The allosteric response found in the lactose repressor and many other proteins has been extended to a variety of cellular signaling pathways in all organisms.

Using a thermodynamic model, we characterize the interplay between TF copy number and the demand for that TF. We demonstrate the parameter-free predictive power of this model as a function of the copy number of the TF and the number and affinities of the available specific binding sites; such predictive control is important for the understanding of transcription and the desire to quantitatively design the output of genetic circuits. Finally, we use these experiments to dynamically measure plasmid copy number through the cell cycle. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Allostery, the modulation of function of a protein at one site by the binding of a ligand at a different site, is a property of many proteins. Two kinetically distinct models have been proposed: i) The induced fit model in which the ligand binds to the protein and then induces the conformational change. ii) The population selection model, in which the protein spontaneously undergoes a conformational change, which is then 'captured' by the ligand. Using measured kinetic constants for the lac repressor the contribution of population selection vs. induced dissociation is quantified by simulating the kinetics of allostery. At very low inducer concentration, both mechanisms contribute significantly. Total induction, though, is small under these conditions. At increasing levels of induction the induced dissociation mechanism soon dominates, first due to binding of one inducer, and then from two inducers binding. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The lac operon is a model system for understanding how effector molecules regulate transcription and are necessary for allosteric transitions. The crystal structures of the lac repressor bound to inducer and anti-inducer molecules provide a model for how these small molecules can modulate repressor function. The structures of the apo repressor and the repressor bound to effector molecules are compared in atomic detail. All effectors examined here bind to the repressor in the same location and are anchored to the repressor through hydrogen bonds to several hydroxyl groups of the sugar ring. Inducer molecules form a more extensive hydrogen-bonding network compared to anti-inducers and neutral effector molecules. The structures of these effector molecules suggest that the O6 hydroxyl on the galactoside is essential for establishing a water-mediated hydrogen bonding network that bridges the N-terminal and C-terminal sub-domains. The altered hydrogen bonding can account in part for the different structural conformations of the repressor, and is vital for the allosteric transition. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Thermodynamic models are based on the assumption that the level of gene expression is proportional to the equilibrium probability that RNA polymerase (RNAP) is bound to the promoter of interest. Statistical mechanics provides a framework for computing these probabilities. Within this framework, interactions of activators, repressors, helper molecules and RNAP are described by a single function, the 'regulation factor'. This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To expand our understanding of the hallmarks of allosteric control we used directed-evolution to engineer alternate cooperative communication in the lactose repressor protein (LacI) scaffold. Starting with an I(s) type LacI mutant D88A (i.e. a LacI variant that is insensitive to the exogenous ligand isopropyl-$\beta$-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and remains bound to operator DNA, + or -IPTG) we used error-prone polymerase chain reaction to introduce compensatory mutations to restore modulated DNA binding function to the allosterically 'dead' I(s)D88A background. Five variants were generated, three variants (C4, C32 and C80) with wild-type like function and two co-repressor variants (C101 and C140) that are functionally inverted. To better resolve the residues that define new allosteric networks in the LacI variants, we conducted mutational tolerance analysis via saturation mutagenesis at each of the evolved positions to assess sensitivity to mutation-a hallmark of allosteric residues. To better understand the physicochemical bases of alternate allosteric function, variant LacIC80 was characterized to assess IPTG ligand binding at equilibrium, kinetically using stopped-flow, and via isothermal titration calorimetry. These data suggest that the conferred modulated DNA binding function observed for LacIC80, while thermodynamically similar to wild-type LacI, is mechanistically different from the wild-type repressor, suggesting a new allosteric network and communication route.},

@article{Daly1986,
abstract = {The lactose repressor protein has been modified with three sulfhydryl-specific reagents which form mixed disulfide adducts. Methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) completely reacted with all three cysteine residues, whereas only partial reaction was observed with didansylcystine. Cysteines-107 and -140 reacted stoichiometrically with MMTS and DTNB, while Cys-281 was modified only at higher molar ratios. Didansylcystine reacted primarily with cysteines-107 and -140. Affinity of MMTS-modified repressor for 40 base pair operator DNA was decreased 30-fold compared to unmodified repressor, and this decrease correlated with modification of cysteine-281. DTNB-modified repressor bound operator DNA with a 50-fold weaker affinity than unmodified repressor. Modification of the lac repressor with didanylcystine decreased operator binding only 4-fold, and nonspecific DNA binding increased 3-fold compared to unmodified repressor. No change in the inducer equilibrium binding constant was observed following modification with any of these reagents. In contrast, inducer association and dissociation rate constants were decreased approximately 50-fold for repressor completely modified with MMTS or DTNB, while didansylcystine had minimal effect on inducer binding kinetics. Correlation between modification of Cys-281 and the observed decrease in rate constants indicates that this region of the protein regulates the accessibility of the sugar binding site. The parallel between the increase in the Kd for repressor binding to operator, the altered rate constant for inducer binding, and modification of cysteine-281 suggests that this region of the protein is crucially involved in the function of the repressor protein.},

abstract = {Molecular recognition is central to all biological processes. For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

With the use of statistical mechanics, the mathematical implementation of the MWC concept links problems that seem otherwise to have no ostensible biological connection including ligand-receptor binding, ligand-gated ion channels, chemotaxis, chromatin structure and gene regulation. Hence, a thorough mathematical analysis of the MWC model can illuminate the performance limits of a number of unrelated biological systems in one stroke. The goal of our review is twofold. First, we describe in detail the general physical principles that are used to derive the activity of MWC molecules as a function of their regulatory ligands. Second, we illustrate the power of ideas from information theory and dynamical systems for quantifying how well the output of MWC molecules tracks their sensory input, giving a sense of the "design" constraints faced by these receptors. ?? 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract The recombinant production of Lac repressor (LacI) in Escherichia coli is complicated by its ubiquitous use as a regulatory element in commercially-available expression vectors and host strains. While LacI-regulated expression systems are often used to produce recombinant LacI, the product can be heterogeneous and unsuitable for some studies. Alternative approaches include using unregulated vectors which typically suffer from low yield or vectors with promoters induced by metabolically active sugars which can dilute isotope labels necessary for certain biophysical studies. Here, an optimized expression system and isolation protocol for producing various constructs of LacI is introduced which eliminates these complications. The expression vector is an adaptation of the pASK backbone wherein expression of the lacI gene is regulated by an anhydrotetracyline inducible tetA promoter and the host strain lacks the lacI gene. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are nearly 2-fold greater than those previously reported. Notably, the new expression system is also able to produce the isolated regulatory domain of LacI without co-expression of the full-length protein and without any defects in cell viability, eliminating the inconvenient requirement for strict monitoring of cell densities during pre-culturing. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are significantly greater than those previously reported. Characterization by solution {\{}NMR{\}} shows that LacI constructs produced using this expression system are highly homogenous and functionally active. },
