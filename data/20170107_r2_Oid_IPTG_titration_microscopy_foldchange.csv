# Description :
# IPTG titration with HG104 strains in Oid.
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + spec. Then they
# were diluted in the evening 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in
# deep 96-well plates with the following IPTG concentrations and mounted on
# agarose pads: 0uM, 0.1uM, 1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM,
# 500uM, 1000uM Comments: These data have been thresholded such that only cells
# with areas between 0.5 µm^2 and 6µm^2 and eccentricities > 0.8 are
# selected.note that 100 uM HG105 had to be re-imaged several times and may not
# be good if the same spot was re-imaged. We might want to ignore if data point
# is strange.
