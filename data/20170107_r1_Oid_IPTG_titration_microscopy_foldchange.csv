# Description :
# IPTG titration with HG104 strains in Oid.
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + spec. Then they
# were diluted in the evening 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in
# deep 96-well plates with the following IPTG concentrations and mounted on
# agarose pads: 0uM, 0.1uM, 1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM,
# 500uM, 1000uM Comments: These data have been thresholded such that only cells
# with areas between 0.5 µm^2 and 6µm^2 and eccentricities > 0.8 are selected. In this experiment, the autofluorescent strains  10 and 100 uM IPTG appeared to be contaminated with brightly fluorescent cells. These two autofluorescent samples were removed.
