# Description :
# IPTG titration with RBS1027 strains in O1.
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + spec. Then they were
# diluted next morning 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in deep 96-well plates with the following
# IPTG concentrations and mounted on agarose pads:
# 0uM, 0.1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM, 500uM, 1000uM, 5000uM
# Comments:
# These data have been thresholded such that only cells with areas between 0.5
# µm^2 and 6µm^2 and eccentricities > 0.8 are selected.
