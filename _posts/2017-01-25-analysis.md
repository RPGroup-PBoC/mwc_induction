## Tutorials
In the interest of transparent science, we have written Jupyter notebook tutorials for each major data analysis section in the publication. You can either read our analysis rendered in HTML or download the `.ipynb` file and run the analysis on your own machine.

* [Unsupervised gating](../../../../code/notebooks/unsupervised_gating.html) \| An example of how our automated gating function works on raw flow cytometry data. [`.ipynb` file]()

* [Image processing](../../../../code/notebooks/single_cell_microscopy.html) \| An example of how microscopy images were processed including single-cell segmentation and correction for non-uniform illumination. [`.ipynb` file]()

* [Bayesian Parameter Estimation](../../../../code/notebooks/bayesian_parameter_estimation.html) \| A complete primer on our parameter estimation procedure using Bayesian inference.

* [Global fits](../../../../code/notebooks/global_fits.html) \| Fitting all model parameters to the pooled flow cytometry data. 

## Additional Analysis
