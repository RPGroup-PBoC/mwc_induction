## Final Experimental Data

All experimentally measured fold-change values used in this publication are available here:

* [Fold-change measurements from flow cytometry]()

* [Fold-change measurements from single cell microscopy]()


Notes for individual experimental runs can be downloaded here:

* [Comments for flow-cytomery experiments]()

* [Comments for microscopy experiments]()


The Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo sampler flat chains used in the Bayesian parameter estimation can be downloaded here:

* [MCMC Sampler Flatchains (`.pkl` file)]



## Raw Experimental Data

All raw experimental data (including `.fcs` and `ome.tiff` files) can be accessed through the link below as a single `.zip` file.

* [Raw flow cytometry and microscopy data]()


## Example Data

Please see the [analysis page]() for examples of the data analysis and parameter estimation. If you would like to run the code yourself, you will need to either [clone this github repository]() or download the example data
sets below.
