## Abstract

Allosteric molecules serve as regulators of cellular signaling across all
domains of life.  We present a theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation
that permits quantitative predictions for how physiological responses are tuned to environmental stimuli. To test the model's predictive
power, we apply it to the ubiquitous simple repression motif in *Escherichia coli*. We
measure the fold-change in gene expression at different inducer concentrations in a collection of strains that span a range of
repressor copy numbers and operator binding strengths. After inferring the inducer dissociation constants using data
from a single strain, we show the broad reach of the model by predicting the induction profiles of all other strains.
Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy which enables us to collapse all of the data into a single master curve, capturing all the phenomenology of the induction profiles.
