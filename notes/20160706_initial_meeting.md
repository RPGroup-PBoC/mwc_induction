#Meeting notes for July 7, 2016

These notes correspond to the intial meeting held on July 6, 2016 and were
transcribed from Tal's summary email. As the project moves forward, it would be
useful to add brief summaries of our meetings here. Tasks of inidividuals are
marked in bold and will be opened as [issues](https://github.com/RPGroup-PBoC/mwc_induction/issues).

##Major parts of this project

* Repressor copy number
	+ Let's hit this hard and fast
	+ Double check that the Bjorkman lab has a 96-well plate reader for the
	    MACSQuant VYB FLow Cytometer that we can respectfully borrow. If
	    not, look into the Caltech facility (**Manuel**).
	+ Double check some strains with microscopy.

* Investigating inducer mutants (future direction)
	+ After incorporating Mitch's murtants (Stephanie/Nathan already did
	    some of this), double check repressor copy number. Can we  bypass
	    immunoblots?

* Plasmids (future direction)
	+ Use Franz's theory ot analyze what happens when the copy number can
	    fluctuate greatly.

##To-Do

* Unify growth conditions

* Unify measurement parameters (same settings on flow cytometer)

* Lab Notebook - Individual Benchling lab notebooks (**Manuel**) and GitHub
    (**Griffin**).

* Data storage/analysis
	+ Data Should be stored on Github (**Manuel and Griffin**) either as:
		- ``data/flow/YearMonthDay-XX``
		- ``data/microscopy/YearMonthDay-XX``
	+ Writing paper in a folder called ``doc`` (**Griffin**)
		- Generate shared Mendeley account (**Tal**).
	+ Write analysis scripts and functions in a portable manner
	    (**Manuel and Griffin**).

* Theory
	+ How to account for repressor copy number error in fits?
	+ How to get an error on the fit parameters (MCMC) as well as
	    confidence in the overal fitting.
